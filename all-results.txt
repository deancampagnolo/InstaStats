I tried many different binning strategies and ultimately found one that I thought maximized the accuracy the best. I
also learned on piazza that we should try not normalizing the data before passing it into the nltk pos taggers.
However when I tested this I received much worse results ( a almost 10 point decrease in percentage) than normalizing
the data beforehand.

As for my accuracies: I received a 86.7% on the only words feature; received a 75.3% on words and pos feature;
received a 77.8% on words pos liwc features. To reiterate - My best feature set was the only words feature at 86.7%.
